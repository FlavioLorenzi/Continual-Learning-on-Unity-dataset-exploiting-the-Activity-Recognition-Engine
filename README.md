Recognizing human actions is a challenging task and actively research in computer vision community. The task of Human Action Recognition (HAR) has grown more attention in many real-world applications such as video surveillance system, health care, sports analysis and smart home...

In this work we are interested to generate a model which generalize very well over different activities, trying to go beyond the state of art, implementing the innovative keypoints of Continual Learning techniques.


### First Part: dataset generation & ar engine setup

- [Unity](./Dataset_generation_using_Unity/ReadMe.md): scene making and synthetic dataset generation (C#)
- Real dataset retrieve
- [Activity Recognition Engine](./Activity_Recognition_Engine) setup: training and testing over real & synthetic dataset (Python), after [Tensorflow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/serving/rest_simple) setup

### Second Part: CL implementation

- Continual learning (A): understanding how to set and apply this innovative approach (EWC vs catastrophic forgetting)
- Continuals learning (B): on-board implementing
- Continual learning (C): training both the synthetic and the real dataset and see the results

### Third Part:

- State of art comparison
