# Continuous-Learning-on-Unity-dataset-exploiting-the-Activity-Recognition-Engine
(Work In Progress)

First Part:

- Unity section: engine understanding and synthetic dataset making
- LSTM understanding: training and testing with a real dataset and a default network

Second Part:

- Continuous learning (A): understanding how to set and fit this innovative approach (EWC vs catastrophic forgetting)
- Continuous learning (B): training both the synthetic dataset and the real dataset and see the results

Third Part:

- Custom LSTM and find better results
