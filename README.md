# Continuous-Learning-on-Unity-dataset-exploiting-the-Activity-Recognition-Engine
(Work In Progress)

First Part:

- [Unity](./Dataset_generation_using_Unity/ReadMe.md): scene making and synthetic dataset generation (C#)
- Real dataset retrieve
- Activity Recognition engine setup: training and testing over real & synthetic dataset (Python)

Second Part:

- Continuous learning (A): understanding how to set and apply this innovative approach (EWC vs catastrophic forgetting)
- Continuous learning (B): training both the synthetic and the real dataset and see the results

Third Part:

- Custom LSTM to find better results
