# Unity Scene Making & Dataset Generation

Unity is the most popular cross-platform game engine that packs a lot of features together and is flexible enough to create almost any game you can imagine. Thanks to a well-made graphical interface and the possibility of inserting C # scripts to control each object inside it, it is also possible to easily create "scenes" depicting everything we want.
In this context we are interested in the random generation of 3D scenes depicting three types of actions: "Hands Up", "Man Down" and "Waving Hands".

The initial setup was possible thanks to:

Each scene is characterized by a randomization of cameras (4 pov),texture and materials, objects, people and animations
