# Preprocessing input data for activity recognition engine

## Steps done

### Collect Unity dataset for each activity (250 RGB frames + labels captures.json)

The run button cannot be called multiple times from Unity platform; so I used linux xdotool to repeat mouse movement and click 1k times the run button for each camera view (4). Obviously this is done for all the 3 activities, so we have 1000 x 4 x 3 samples = 12k.

### Convert Unity dataset to oid format

### Convert oid dataset to our final preprocessed ar_dataset
