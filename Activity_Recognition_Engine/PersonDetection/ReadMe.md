# Person Detection using YOLO and COCO dataset

This section is developed by following a KMLE bitbucket repo on Yolo_v4 software; the model is pretrained over the COCO dataset (https://cocodataset.org/#home).

To achieve our task, I implemented a python filter to detect only people and weapons (in this case I set a baseball bat, but this can be changed for examples with guns or knifes as future work, because these are not in the coco dataset).

The engine is implemented in a python virtual env and runned with docker: this allows us to exchange informations with TF-Serving.


First results are the following:

In my synthetic dataset (made up with Unity):
