## AR engine

The engine was carried out step by step, putting together different works and results obtained, with the aim of creating a cascade structure, characterized by:


INPUT (Unity Scene Dataset) (Activities: HANDS UP, WAVING HANDS, MAN DOWN)

[Person detection engine](./Person \Detection \Yolo) (YOLOv4) <--> Tensorflow serving (models.pb)

Skeleton Estimation <--> Tensorflow serving (models.pb)

LSTM training and inference <--> Tensorflow serving (models.pb)

OUTPUT (for each scene recognize the activity)
