# Skeleton Estimation

This part was executed first locally, by following

https://github.com/akanazawa/hmr

(Tensorflow 1.3.0 and python 2.7)

and

https://github.com/russoale/hmr2.0

(Tensorflow 2 and python 3.8)

My work is based on this last repo, because the first one has an old setup (obsolete).


First results:

Then I saved the generator model of the network into .pb file to switch into Tensorflow Serving.
